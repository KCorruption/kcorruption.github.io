	<h2>
	Introduced during the legion expansion, these optional quests that appear through your travels have various objectives & rewards such as equipment, gold, reputation gains, etc. While a lot of older expansions have had their rewards nerfed over the years, some may still have some value.

		Dragon Isles World Quests
	</a>
</div>

	<p>
		As of writing this (2023), Dragonflight is the current expansion, and the world quests are plentiful in number as well as bountiful in their rewards.
		While the main attraction in these is undeniably the often-times short and exhilirating "racing" world quests, there are also plenty of other options if you've a keen eye to make gold by doing them.
	</p>

	<p>
		The races themselves (as of writing this, the current patch is 10.1), it takes roughly 20 minutes to complete all races when they are available, rewarding a nice 3600 - 3700g for the time spent. These races can be done once per character every few days, and are fairly short to complete; the longest taking slightly over 60 seconds. 
	</p>

	<p>
		The majority of the time spent doing these will be the travel time it takes to get from one race to another, as there is usually 1 race per zone (with the exception being the newly added Zaralek Cavern, which has 2.)
