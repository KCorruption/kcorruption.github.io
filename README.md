This is a project I'm using as a means to help learn web dev with HTML & CSS.
Everything I've done so far as been a result of consultation with chatGPT (gathering info, understanding how things work)
As well as other resources such as W3 schools.

The subject is for world of warcraft, and features topics like fun items, and gold making methods.
