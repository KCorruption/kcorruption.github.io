	This section pertains to the auction house, so it's a great idea if you don't already have it, to obtain & learn how to use the addon <a href="https://www.tradeskillmaster.com" target="_blank">Trade Skill Master</a> as well as its companion application of the same name.

		In world of warcraft, there are many different armor and weapon types, and even among those, many different appearances one might choose from should they wish to change their look.
	</p>

	<p>
	Transmog relies heavily on the interest of other players. This said, the price of style can wildly increase or decrease depending on supply & demand. Transmog based items don't tend to sell often, so it is usually best to deal with items that are either cheap to post, or have a high potential payout.
	</p>

	<p>
		Addons can be a great help in determining what has the best sale potential when dealing with Transmog, and I personally prefer to list transmog sales on an alt dedicated to either bank storage or auction house interactions, since these items can take up valuable inventory space should they be slow to sell.
